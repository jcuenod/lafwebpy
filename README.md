# Basically Nameless Project

What's more exciting than a name, however, is the fact that we will one day be able rapidly to query Hebrew data... The stuff dreams are made of!

To run, you need `laf-fabric` and `bottle`. You also need [laf-fabric-data](https://github.com/ETCBC/laf-fabric-data) so follow the link and read the readme (it's short) and make sure you set up laf-fabric.cfg (in this folder, it's `.gitignore`d). Then cd into this directory and:

    python3 index.py

and visit `localhost:8080/` in your favourite browser.

**NB: Make sure you have 4-6GB of RAM free before doing this or your machine may lock up...**
